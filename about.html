<h1 class="about-header">ABOUT ME</h1>>
<p class="about-text">My name is Jess! I'm 20 and currently a design/business student in NY. I dabble in a lot of different art styles and mediums, but my favorite thing to do is create characters and flesh them out through art, writing, etc etc. A lot of my art revolves around music as well, as it is one of my biggest inspirations. I like going to concerts, meeting bands I love, and giving them art related to their music.</p>

<div class="band"><img src="images/dallon.png" alt="me giving dallon from the band idkhow my art">
<img src="images/phone.jpg" alt="the band phoneboy looking at my art with big smiles"></div>

<p class="about-text">I started posting my art onlne when I was 14, and through that I've connected and collaberated wtih some amazing other artists, and been showcased & reposted by people I look up to! Now I'm able to sell work and get it out into the world.</p>

<p class="about-text">In high school, I realized being creative full-time was actually feasible. This is my attempt to make that happen. :)</p>
